**Next.js can be installed in two ways: 1. Automatic installation 2. Manual installation. Here we'll look at the automatic installation process, as this is what Next.js recommends. If you want to learn about manual installation, then [click here](https://nextjs.org/docs/14/getting-started/installation#manual-installation)**

## Installation

**Automatic Installation**  
The easiest and automatic method to create a Next.js app is to use `create-next-app`. It automatically sets up everything. To create a project with Next.js, follow the processes below.


**Start installing the new application by entering the following command in the terminal**  
```bash filename="Terminal" 
npx create-next-app@latest  
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Using `@latest` after `npx create-next-app` will always install the latest version. Since Next.js version 15 has been released currently, in this case too, Next.js version 15 will be installed. But if you need to install a specific version, you should add the version number after `npx create-next-app`, e.g. `@14`
</Callout>


During installation, you will be asked some questions:  

```plaintext  filename="Terminal" 
What is your project named? my-app  
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes  
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes  
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes  
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes  
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes  
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes  
What import alias would you like configured? @/*  
```  

After answering these questions, `create-next-app` will create a folder based on your project name and install all the necessary dependencies.  

### **Important information:**  
- Next.js now comes with default configurations for TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS.  
- You can optionally use the `src` directory in the root directory, so that your application code and configuration files are separate.
