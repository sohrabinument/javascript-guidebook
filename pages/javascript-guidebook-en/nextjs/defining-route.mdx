**Defining Routes in Next.js**  

Next.js uses a **file-system based router**, where folders work as route segments. Each folder maps to a URL segment. And nested routes can be created by nesting folders inside folders.

### **Creating Routes:**  
In Next.js, routes are created using a `page.js` or `page.tsx` file. The content in this page will be the content of this route. If there is no `page.js` or `page.tsx` file in the route segments, then the route will not be created.
Here,
- Each folder represents a route segment.  
- **Nested Routes:** Routes can be further nested by nesting folders inside.  

### **Example:**  
#### `/dashboard/analytics` route  
If there is no `page.js` file in the **dashboard** or **analytics** folders, then that route cannot be accessed publicly.  
However, you can keep other files (such as components, CSS files, images) in these folders.  


#### **Note:**  
- Any file extension can be used: `.js`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`.  
- Having a `page.js` or `page.tsx` means that route will be publicly accessible.

### **Important Points:**  
1. **Folders are route segments.**  
   - Example: `app/blog` means the `/blog` route.  
2. **To create a page, a `page.js` file must exist**  
3. **You can keep files other than page files to share layouts or components.**
