This is another "escape hatch". We know that React batches its state updates and the updated values are only available in the next render.

But if we want to update state synchronously and ensure that code below the state update executes only after the state has been updated, we can use `flushSync`. This is a method from `react-dom`. It pauses the execution of code below it until the state update is complete, and tells React to update the state first before executing the following lines.

So if we want to force a state update to occur before moving to the next line, we need to wrap the state's `setter function` in a callback passed to the `flushSync` method.

```jsx
import { flushSync } from "react-dom";

flushSync(() => {
    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);
});
```
