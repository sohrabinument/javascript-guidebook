A: Reusability, separation of concerns, easier maintenance, and better organization.

**Q6: Can you nest function definitions inside a component? Why or why not?**  
A: No, you should not nest function definitions inside a component. Instead, define helper functions outside or as separate components to keep code clean and maintainable.

**Q7: Scenario: You have a button that is used in multiple places with different labels. How would you design this as a reusable component?**  
A: Create a Button component that accepts a label prop and use it wherever needed, passing different labels as props.
