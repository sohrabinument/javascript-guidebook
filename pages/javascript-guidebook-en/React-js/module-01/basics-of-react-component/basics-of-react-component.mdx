# 🧩 Basics of React Components

Welcome! Components are the heart of React. They help you build UIs that are reusable, organized, and fun to work with. Let's dive in and see how you can master them! 🚀

## 🏗️ What is a React Component?

A **component** is a reusable, self-contained piece of UI in React. Components are the building blocks of a React application—each part of your UI, from a button to an entire page, can be a component. Components help you break down complex interfaces into smaller, manageable, and reusable pieces.

## 💡 Why Use Components?

- **Reusability:** Write once, use anywhere in your app.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each component handles its own logic and UI.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to update, debug, and test.

## 🧑‍💻 Types of Components

- **Function Components:** The most common and modern way to write components. They are JavaScript functions that return JSX.
- **Class Components:** An older way, now less common, using ES6 classes.

## ✨ Creating a Function Component

```jsx
export default function Profile() {
  return (

      alt="Profile Example"
    />
  );
}
```

**Key Points:**

- The function name must start with a capital letter.
- The function returns JSX (markup).
- Use `export default` to make the component available for import elsewhere.

## 🧩 Using Components

You can use a component inside another component just like a custom HTML tag:

```jsx
import Profile from "./Profile";

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

## 🏆 Best Practices & Rules

<Callout type="warning">
  Component names must start with a capital letter!
</Callout>

- **Return JSX from your component function.**
- **Do not define another function inside a component (define helper functions outside or as separate components).**
- **If a component is small and not reused, it can be defined in the same file. For larger or reusable components, use separate files.**

## ✅ Quick Recap & Next Steps

- Components make your UI modular and reusable.
- Always start component names with a capital letter.
- Practice by building your own small components!
