# 🧩 Understanding Props in React

Welcome! Props are the secret sauce for making your React components dynamic and reusable. Let's learn how to use them like a pro! 🚀

---

## 🤔 What are Props?

Props (short for "properties") are how React components communicate with each other. They let you pass data from a parent component to a child component, just like passing arguments to a function.

<Callout type="info">
  Think of props as the way you send gifts (data) from one component to another!
</Callout>

---

## 📦 Passing Props to a Component

You can pass props to a component by adding them as attributes in JSX:

```jsx
function Avatar(props) {
  return <img src={props.src} alt={props.alt} />;
}

function Profile() {
  return <Avatar src="avatar.png" alt="Profile picture" />;
}
```

Here, `Profile` passes `src` and `alt` props to `Avatar`.

---

## 🔍 Reading Props in a Component

You can access props in the function parameter:

```jsx
function Avatar({ src, alt }) {
  return <img src={src} alt={alt} />;
}
```

This is called "destructuring" and makes your code cleaner.

---

## 🏷️ Default Props

You can specify a default value for a prop using destructuring:

```jsx
function Avatar({ src, alt = "User avatar" }) {
  return <img src={src} alt={alt} />;
}
```

If `alt` is not provided, it will default to "User avatar".

<Callout type="info">
  Default props help prevent missing or undefined values in your UI!
</Callout>

---

## 🚫 Props are Read-Only

Props cannot be changed by the child component. If you want to change a value, you must do it in the parent and pass the new value down as a prop.

<Callout type="warning">
  Never try to modify props inside a child component. Always update them in the parent!
</Callout>

---

## 🔄 Forwarding Props

You can forward all props from one component to another using the spread syntax:

```jsx
function Profile(props) {
  return <Avatar {...props} />;
}
```

Use this with care, as it can make your code less explicit.

---

## 🧒 Passing JSX as Children

You can nest components or elements inside another component. The nested content is available as the `children` prop:

```jsx
function Card({ children }) {
  return <div className="card">{children}</div>;
}

function Profile() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Avatar src="avatar.png" alt="Profile" />
    </Card>
  );
}
```

<Callout type="success">
  The `children` prop is super useful for building flexible layouts and reusable components!
</Callout>

---

## 📝 Key Points
- Props let you pass data from parent to child components.
- Props are read-only in the child.
- You can set default values for props.
- You can forward props using the spread syntax.
- The `children` prop lets you nest content inside components.
