## 1.1 – Component Organization & Exports 🗂️

<div style={{ background: 'rgba(0, 100, 200, 0.10)', padding: '15px', borderRadius: '5px', marginBottom: '20px', border: '1px solid rgba(0, 100, 200, 0.15)', color: 'inherit' }}>

**Q1: Why should you split components into separate files?**  
A: For better organization, reusability, and maintainability of your code.

**Q2: What is the difference between default and named exports in React?**  
A: Default export allows only one export per file and can be imported with any name. Named exports allow multiple exports per file and must be imported with the same name.

**Q3: How do you import a default export?**  
A: `import ComponentName from './ComponentFile';`

**Q4: How do you import a named export?**  
A: `import { ComponentName } from './ComponentFile';`

## 1.2 – Advanced Usage & Scenarios 🚀

<div style={{ background: 'rgba(230, 150, 70, 0.10)', padding: '15px', borderRadius: '5px', marginBottom: '20px', border: '1px solid rgba(230, 150, 70, 0.15)', color: 'inherit' }}>

**Q5: Can you have both default and named exports in the same file? How do you import them?**  
A: Yes. Import the default export without braces and named exports with braces:  
`import DefaultComponent, { NamedComponent } from './ComponentFile';`

**Q6: What happens if you try to import a named export as a default import, or vice versa?**  
A: You will get an error; the import/export syntax must match.

**Q7: Scenario: You want to use both `Gallery` and `Profile` from the same file. How would you export and import them?**  
A: Export one as default and the other as named, or both as named. Import accordingly:  
`import Gallery, { Profile } from './Gallery';` or `import { Gallery, Profile } from './Gallery';`

**Q8: Why is it discouraged to use anonymous default exports (like `export default () => {}`)?**  
A: It makes debugging harder because the component will not have a meaningful name in error messages or React DevTools.

## Practice Interview Exercise 🏋️‍♂️

<div style={{ background: 'rgba(20, 120, 220, 0.10)', padding: '20px', borderRadius: '5px', marginBottom: '20px', border: '1px solid rgba(20, 120, 220, 0.15)', color: 'inherit' }}>

### Scenario-Based Question:

You're working on a React app with a growing number of components. You notice that some files are getting very large and hard to manage.

**Question:** What steps would you take to organize your components and their exports/imports for better maintainability and scalability?

Take a moment to formulate your answer before checking the suggested response.

**Best Practices:**

1. Split components into separate files based on functionality.
2. Use default export for the main component in a file, and named exports for helpers.
3. Use meaningful and consistent file/component names.
4. Group related components in folders.
5. Use index.js files for cleaner imports if needed.
6. Avoid anonymous default exports for better debugging.

**Benefits:**
- Easier to find and maintain code
- Better reusability
- Fewer merge conflicts in teams

**Tip:** Review these questions and answers, and try to explain each concept in your own words for the best interview preparation!

> **🚀 Final Advice:** In interviews, show not just your knowledge of import/export syntax, but also your understanding of why good organization matters and how you'd apply it in real-world React projects.
