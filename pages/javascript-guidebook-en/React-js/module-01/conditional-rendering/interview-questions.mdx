# Conditional Rendering Interview Questions & Answers üéØ

Use these questions to prepare for interviews or test your understanding of conditional rendering in React.

> **üí° Pro Tip:** Try answering each question yourself before checking the answer. This will help you remember the concepts better!

## 1.1 ‚Äì Conditional Rendering Fundamentals üå±

<div style={{ background: 'rgba(0, 100, 200, 0.10)', padding: '15px', borderRadius: '5px', marginBottom: '20px', border: '1px solid rgba(0, 100, 200, 0.15)', color: 'inherit' }}>

**Q1: What is conditional rendering in React?**  
A: Conditional rendering in React is the process of displaying different UI elements or components based on certain conditions, such as state or props. It allows you to control what gets rendered to the DOM depending on logic in your application.

**Q2: How can you implement conditional rendering in JSX?**  
A: You can implement conditional rendering in JSX using JavaScript expressions like if/else statements, the ternary operator (`condition ? expr1 : expr2`), and the logical AND (`&&`) operator. For example:  
```jsx
{isLoggedIn ? <Dashboard /> : <Login />}
```

**Q3: Can you return `null` from a React component? What does it do?**  
A: Yes, you can return `null` from a React component. When you do so, nothing is rendered to the DOM for that component.

## 1.2 ‚Äì Intermediate Usage üí°

<div style={{ background: 'rgba(230, 150, 70, 0.10)', padding: '15px', borderRadius: '5px', marginBottom: '20px', border: '1px solid rgba(230, 150, 70, 0.15)', color: 'inherit' }}>

**Q4: What is the difference between using if/else and the ternary operator in React components?**  
A: The if/else statement is used outside of JSX to decide which JSX to return, while the ternary operator can be used directly inside JSX expressions. The ternary operator is more concise and is suitable for inline conditional rendering.

**Q5: How does the logical AND (`&&`) operator work for conditional rendering in React?**  
A: The logical AND (`&&`) operator renders the right-hand side expression only if the left-hand side condition is true. If the condition is false, nothing is rendered. For example:  
```jsx
{hasUnread && <p>You have unread messages!</p>}
```

**Q6: How would you render a component only if a list is not empty?**  
A: You can use the logical AND (`&&`) operator to render a component only if a list has items:  
```jsx
{items.length > 0 && <ItemList items={items} />}
```

</div>

## 1.3 ‚Äì Best Practices & Scenario-Based üß†

<div style={{ background: 'rgba(220, 50, 50, 0.10)', padding: '15px', borderRadius: '5px', marginBottom: '20px', border: '1px solid rgba(220, 50, 50, 0.15)', color: 'inherit' }}>

**Q7: What are some best practices for keeping conditional rendering code readable?**  
A:
- Use the ternary operator for simple conditions.
- Use if/else or assign JSX to variables for more complex logic.
- Avoid deeply nested ternary operators.
- Extract complex conditional logic into separate functions or components.

**Q8: Scenario: You want to show a loading spinner while data is being fetched, and the data once it's loaded. How would you implement this?**  
A: Use a state variable (e.g., `isLoading`). Render the spinner if `isLoading` is true, otherwise render the data. For example:  
```jsx
{isLoading ? <Spinner /> : <DataView data={data} />}
```

**Q9: Scenario: You want to display an error message only if an error exists. How would you do this?**  
A: Use the logical AND operator:  
```jsx
{error && <p className="error">{error}</p>}
```

</div>

## Practice Interview Exercise üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

<div style={{ background: 'rgba(20, 120, 220, 0.10)', padding: '20px', borderRadius: '5px', marginBottom: '20px', border: '1px solid rgba(20, 120, 220, 0.15)', color: 'inherit' }}>

### Scenario-Based Question:

You have a dashboard that shows user data. If the user is not logged in, you want to show a login prompt. If the user is logged in but has no data, show a message. If the user is logged in and has data, show the dashboard.

**Question:** How would you structure your conditional rendering logic in this scenario?

Take a moment to formulate your answer before checking the suggested response.

<details>
<summary>**Click to see a sample answer**</summary>

**Sample Approach:**

```jsx
if (!isLoggedIn) {
  return <LoginPrompt />;
}
if (data.length === 0) {
  return <p>No data available.</p>;
}
return <Dashboard data={data} />;
```

- Use early returns for clear, readable logic.
- Avoid deeply nested ternaries.
- Show only the relevant UI for each state.

**Tip:** Review these questions and answers, and try to explain each concept in your own words for the best interview preparation!

> **üöÄ Final Advice:** In interviews, show not just your knowledge of conditional rendering, but also your ability to write clean, maintainable logic for real-world scenarios.
