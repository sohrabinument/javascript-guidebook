# Event Propagation – Interview Questions & Answers 🎯

Use these questions to prepare for interviews or test your understanding of event propagation in React.

> **💡 Pro Tip:** Try answering each question yourself before checking the answer. This will help you remember the concepts better!

## 1.1 – Event Propagation Fundamentals 🔄

<div style={{ background: 'rgba(0, 100, 200, 0.10)', padding: '15px', borderRadius: '5px', marginBottom: '20px', border: '1px solid rgba(0, 100, 200, 0.15)', color: 'inherit' }}>

**Q1: What is event propagation in React?**  
A: Event propagation is the process by which events travel through the DOM tree in two phases: capturing (from root to target) and bubbling (from target back up to root).

**Q2: Which phase does React's `onClick` handler listen to by default?**  
A: React's `onClick` handler listens during the bubbling phase by default.

**Q3: How can you listen to the capturing phase in React?**  
A: By using props like `onClickCapture` instead of `onClick`.

## 1.2 – Stopping Propagation & Preventing Default 🚦

<div style={{ background: 'rgba(230, 150, 70, 0.10)', padding: '15px', borderRadius: '5px', marginBottom: '20px', border: '1px solid rgba(230, 150, 70, 0.15)', color: 'inherit' }}>

**Q4: How do you stop an event from bubbling up to parent elements?**  
A: Call `e.stopPropagation()` inside your event handler.

**Q5: What is the difference between `e.stopPropagation()` and `e.preventDefault()`?**  
A: `e.stopPropagation()` stops the event from bubbling up the DOM, while `e.preventDefault()` stops the browser's default action (like form submission).

**Q6: Can `e.stopPropagation()` prevent a parent's `onClickCapture` from firing?**  
A: No, `onClickCapture` fires during the capture phase, before bubbling and before `stopPropagation()` can take effect.

## 1.3 – Scenario & Practical Example 🏆

<div style={{ background: 'rgba(20, 120, 220, 0.10)', padding: '20px', borderRadius: '5px', marginBottom: '20px', border: '1px solid rgba(20, 120, 220, 0.15)', color: 'inherit' }}>

### Scenario-Based Question:

Suppose you have a parent `<div>` with an `onClick` handler and a child `<button>` with its own `onClick` handler. What happens if you click the button? How can you make sure only the button's handler runs?

Take a moment to think before checking the answer.

**Sample Answer:**
- By default, both the button's and the parent's `onClick` handlers will run (button first, then parent) due to event bubbling.
- To make sure only the button's handler runs, call `e.stopPropagation()` in the button's handler.
