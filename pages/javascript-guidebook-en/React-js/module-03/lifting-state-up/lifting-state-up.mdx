# Lifting State Up in React 🚀

When building React apps, you'll often find that two or more components need to share and coordinate state. The secret sauce for this is called **Lifting State Up**! Let's dive in and make your components talk to each other like best friends! 🤝

---

## Why Lift State Up? 🤔

Sometimes, you want the state of two components to always change together. For example, you might have a `Products` component and a `Cart` component, and you want both to know what's in the cart. If each keeps its own state, they'll get out of sync! Instead, you should move the shared state up to their closest common parent and pass it down as props. This is called **lifting state up**.

## Real-World Analogy 🌳

Imagine two siblings (components) who want to share a toy (state). If each keeps their own toy, they might fight! But if their parent (common parent component) keeps the toy and gives it to them when needed, everyone's happy and in sync! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

## Step-by-Step: Lifting State Up 🪜

Let's see how to do this with a practical example!

### Scenario: Accordion Panels 📚

Suppose you have an `Accordion` with two `Panel` components. You want only one panel open at a time.

#### 1️⃣ Initial Setup: Local State in Each Panel

```jsx
function Panel({ title, children }) {
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);
  return (
    <section>
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {isActive ? (
        <p>{children}</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => setIsActive(true)}>Show</button>
      )}
    </section>
  );
}

function Accordion() {
  return (
    <>
      <Panel title="About">About content...</Panel>
      <Panel title="Etymology">Etymology content...</Panel>
    </>
  );
}
```

Each `Panel` manages its own state. But clicking one doesn't affect the other. What if you want only one open at a time?

---

#### 2️⃣ Step 1: Remove State from Children 🧹

Move the `isActive` state out of `Panel` and into the parent `Accordion`.

```jsx
function Panel({ title, children, isActive, onShow }) {
  return (
    <section>
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {isActive ? <p>{children}</p> : <button onClick={onShow}>Show</button>}
    </section>
  );
}
```

---

#### 3️⃣ Step 2: Add State to the Common Parent 🏠

Now, let the parent keep track of which panel is open:

```jsx
function Accordion() {
  const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0);
  return (
    <>
      <Panel
        title="About"
        isActive={activeIndex === 0}
        onShow={() => setActiveIndex(0)}
      >
        About content...
      </Panel>
      <Panel
        title="Etymology"
        isActive={activeIndex === 1}
        onShow={() => setActiveIndex(1)}
      >
        Etymology content...
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}
```

Now, only one panel can be open at a time! 🎉

## How Does It Work? 🧠

- **State is stored in the common parent** (e.g., `Accordion`).
- **Children receive state and event handlers as props**.
- **Children call the handler to update the parent's state**.
- **Parent re-renders children with updated props**.

This pattern keeps your UI in sync and avoids bugs! 🐞

## Another Example: Sharing Cart State 🛒

Let's say you have a `Products` and a `Cart` component, both siblings. You want to add products to the cart from `Products` and display them in `Cart`.

```jsx
function App() {
  const [cart, setCart] = useState([]);
  return (
    <>
      <Products cart={cart} setCart={setCart} />
      <Cart cart={cart} />
    </>
  );
}

function Products({ cart, setCart }) {
  const products = [
    { id: 1, name: "Apple 🍎" },
    { id: 2, name: "Banana 🍌" },
  ];
  const addToCart = (product) => setCart([...cart, product]);
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Products</h2>
      {products.map((product) => (
        <div key={product.id}>
          {product.name}
          <button onClick={() => addToCart(product)}>Add to Cart</button>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

function Cart({ cart }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Cart</h2>
      {cart.length === 0 ? (
        <p>No items in cart.</p>
      ) : (
        <ul>
          {cart.map((item, idx) => (
            <li key={idx}>{item.name}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Recap 📝

- 🔼 **Lift state up** to the closest common parent to share it between components.
- 📦 Pass state and updater functions as props.
- 🧩 Children use props to display and update shared state.
- 🧹 This keeps your UI in sync and avoids duplication!

---

## Challenge Yourself! 💡

Try this: You have two input fields. Make them always show the same value, no matter which one you type in!

```jsx
function SyncedInputs() {
  const [text, setText] = useState("");
  return (
    <>
      <input value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <input value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />
    </>
  );
}
```

Can you explain why this works? (Hint: The state is lifted up!)
