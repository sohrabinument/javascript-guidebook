## What are `Components`?

`Component` is one of the core concepts in React. It is often called the building block of UI. Each part of the UI code that can be reused repeatedly can be considered a component. Even a small button can be a component.

React helps us write our markup in small, reusable code blocks, where each block is a component.

However, there are some rules for creating components that are shown below.

## How to create a React `Component`?

A React component is a JavaScript function that combines markup with JavaScript.

**React Component Syntax**

```javascript showLineNumbers filename="profile.jsx"
export default function Profile() {
    return (
        <img
            src='https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3Am.jpg'
            alt='Katherine Johnson'
        />
    );
}
```

**Steps to follow when creating a component:**

<Steps>
    ### Export the component

    Use `export default` to make a component reusable, so that we can `import` and use the component in other files.

    ### Define the function
    After `export default`, define a named function.
    ```javascript showlineNumbers
        export default function Profile(){}
    ```

    <Callout type="warning" emoji='ðŸ’¡'>
        When creating a `React Component`, you must write the first letter of the function name with a `Capital letter`, otherwise it won't work.
    </Callout>

    ### Add markup inside the function

    Return markup using `JSX (Javascript XML)` syntax inside the function.

    ```javascript showLineNumbers {2}
    export default function Profile() {
        return img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
    }
    ```
    **If the `return statement` needs to be written in more than one line, it must be written inside `()`**
    Example:
      ```javascript showLineNumbers filename="Profile.jsx" {2-6}
    export default function Profile() {
        return (
        <div>
             <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
        </div>
        )
    }
    ```

</Steps>

## How to use components:

After creating a component, it can be used within another component in the same file or imported into another file to be used there.

Example:

```javascript showLineNumbers filename="Gallery.jsx"
import Profile from "Profile";
export default function Gallery() {
    return (
        <section>
            <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
            <Profile />
            <Profile />
            <Profile />
        </section>
    );
}
```

## Rules to follow when nesting components:

**`Rule 1` - If a component is very small and won't be reused, it can be written and used in the same file. But if the component is large, has more `interactivity`, and needs to be reused in various places, then it should be created in separate files.**

**`Rule 2` - You can nest one component inside another component, but you cannot nest another function definition inside a component.**
