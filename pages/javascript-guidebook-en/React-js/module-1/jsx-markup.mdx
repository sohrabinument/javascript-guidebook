## What is `JSX`?

`JSX` is a syntax extension of JavaScript that helps us write markup similar to `HTML`. The major advantage of `JSX` is that it allows writing JavaScript logic and `HTML` markup in the same place (inside a component). This gives us extra flexibility when we need to make changes later.

Though `JSX` looks exactly like `HTML`, it is not `HTML`, but rather much more `Strict` than `HTML`. If you make any mistake in `JSX`, it immediately gives an `Error`.

In `HTML`, we can only write static content, but in `JSX`, we can use dynamic values.

## What are the rules for writing `JSX`?

There are several rules to follow in `JSX`:

### 1. Return a Single root element:

`JSX` must return only a single root element. If you need to return multiple elements, you must wrap them with a parent element. In such cases, you can use a `<div> </div>` element. However, using `<div> </div>` will render an additional `<div> </div>` element in the `HTML` `Element Tree`.

❌ Incorrect

```javascript filename= "Profile.jsx  "
export default function Profile() {
    return (
            <h1>Hello Mr XX</h1>
            <p>Your age is 30</p>
        // This code won't work because two elements are being returned
    );
}
```

✅ Correct

```javascript filename= "Profile.jsx  "
export default function Profile() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello Mr XX</h1>
            <p>Your age is 30</p>
        </div>
        // This code will work because two elements are wrapped with a parent `<div> </div>`
    );
}
```

However, if you don't want to render any additional `<div> </div>` element, you can use `<></>`. This is called a `Fragment` tag. Also, if you ever need to pass a `key` inside a `Fragment`, you should write `<Fragment></Fragment>` instead of `<></>`.

#### Why do we need to return a single JSX root?

    <small>**Credit to : Saffaullah Shuvo**</small>

Well, in any programming, a function can only return one data type/structure. For example, a simple number or a complex data structure,

```javascript
function returnOne() { return 1; } // Is it possible to return two numbers?
function returnTwo() { return (100 500) } // This is a syntax error // This means the Compiler doesn't support this syntax

```

So, can't we return two numbers? Yes, we can-

```javascript
function returnTwo() { return [100, 500]; // There are many other ways too }
```

Since JSX is a JavaScript Object:

```javascript
function returnTwoJSX() {
return (<h1>Hi</h1> <h2>Hello</h2>)
 }
  // Behind the scene
  function returnTwoJSX() {
   return (
    {type: 'h1', props: { children: 'Hi'}} // object1
    {type: 'h2', props: { children: 'Hello'}} // object2
    )
    }
     // So this is also a syntax error

```

But we can return it as a single data by putting it inside an Array or inside a parent element.

-   Solution 1 - Wrap with a parent element

```javascript
function returnParentJSX() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hi</h1>
            <h2>Hello</h2>
        </div>
    );
}
// Behind the scene
function returnParentJSX() {
    return {
        type: "div",
        props: { children: [object1, object2] },
        // ...additional properties
    };
}
```

-   Solution 2 - Use Fragment as a parent

```javascript
function returnFragmentJSX() {
    return (
        <Fragment>
            {" "}
            // short form <></>
            <h1>Hi</h1>
            <h2>Hello</h2>
        </Fragment>
    );
}
// Behind the scene
function returnFragmentJSX() {
    return {
        type: Symbol(react.fragment),
        props: { children: [object1, object2] }, // ...additional property
    };
}
```

Will it work if we return a direct Object instead of JSX? For example:

```javascript
function returnDirectObject() {
    return {
        type: "div",
        props: {
            className: "bg-white",
            children: [
                {
                    type: "h1",
                    props: { className: "text-2xl", children: "Hi" },
                },
                { type: "p", props: { children: "Hello World" } },
            ],
        },
    };
}
```

No, because this Object wasn't created in React's way. React keeps additional properties inside the Object. React creates it like this:

```javascript
import { createElement } from "react";

function returnDirectObject() {
    return createElement(
        "div",
        { className: "bg-white" },
        createElement("h1", { className: "text-2xl" }, "Hi"),
        createElement("p", null, "Hello World")
    );
}
```

### 2. Close all the tags:

Every tag used in `JSX` must be closed. Self-closing tags like `<img>`, `<hr>` must also be closed like `<img />`, `<hr />`.

### 3. camelCase ~all~ most of the things!:

Since we are writing `JavaScript` in `JSX`, we need to write `multiple-word` `Attributes` in `camelCase` according to JavaScript rules.

**Since `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, we cannot use `class`. Instead of `class`, we need to use `className`.**
