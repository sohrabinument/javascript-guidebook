## What are `Props`?

In React, `Props` are used to pass data from a `Parent Component` to a `Child Component`. `Props` are similar to function `Parameters`.

We can send `Props` from a `Parent Component` to a `Child Component` just like we write `Attributes` in `HTML`.

**Example:**

```javascript filename="Profile.jsx" {4,5}
export default function Profile() {
    return (
        <Avater //imgurl and size are two props sent to the child component Avater
            imgurl='https://example.com/image/1.png'
            size={100}
        />
    );
}
```

```javascript filename="Avater.jsx" {5-7}
export default function Avater(props) {
    // props are received as an Object named props from the parent Avater component
    return (
        <img
            src={props.imgurl}
            alt='Avater Image'
            size={props.size}
        />
    );
}
```

We can send any JavaScript value in `Props`, even functions.

## How to Send and Receive `Props`?

Below I explain in detail how to send and receive `Props`.

<Steps>
    ### Step 1 :  Pass props to the child component

    ```javascript filename="Profile.jsx"
        export default function Profile() {
            return (
              <Avatar
                person={{ name: 'Lin Lanying', imageId: '1bX5QH6' }}
                size={100}
              />
            );
          }
    ```
    Here, from the `Avatar` component to its child component
    `person` = which is an object,
    `size` = which is a number,
    have been sent.

### Step 2 : Read props inside the child component

```javascript filename="Avater.jsx" {1,5-7}
export default function Avater(props) {
    return (
        <img
            src={props.imgurl}
            alt='Avater Image'
            size={props.size}
        />
    );
}
```

`props` are received as an `Object` named `props` from the `parent Avater` component

</Steps>

## Receiving `Props` using the `Destructuring` method

`Props` can be received using the `Destructuring` method. In that case, we can do it like this:

```javascript filename="Avater.jsx" {1}
export default function Avater({ imgurl, size }) {
    return (
        <img
            src={imgurl}
            alt='Avater Image'
            size={size}
        />
    );
}
```

## Using default values in `Props`

Sometimes the value of `Props` may be `Undefined`. In that case, we might need to set a default value for `Props`. We can set a default value using `=` like this:

```javascript showLineNumbers filename="Avater.jsx" {1}
export default function Avater({ imgurl, size = 100 }) {
    return (
        <img
            src={imgurl}
            alt='Avater Image'
            size={size}
        />
    );
}
```

## Forwarding props with the JSX spread syntax

Sometimes it may happen that we need to forward all the `Props` we received in a component to another child component within that component. In that case, instead of writing all those `Props` again, we can pass them using the `JSX spread syntax` `{...props}`.

In this case, in the main component where we receive the `Props`, we need to receive them as an object named `props` instead of using the `Destructuring Method`.

**Example:**

<Steps>
### Step 1:

First, three `Props` named `name`, `age`, and `gender` are passed from the `App` component to the `Profile` component.

```javascript filename="App.jsx" showLineNumbers
export default function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <div>
                <Profile
                    name='Ripon'
                    age={30}
                    gender='male'
                />
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Step 2:

Here, all the `props` are received as an object named `props` in the `Profile` component.

```javascript filename="Profile.jsx" showLineNumbers {1}
export default function Profile(props) {
    return (
        <div>
            <Card {...props} />
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Step 3:

Here, all the `props` are `Spread` using `{...props}` and sent to the `Card` component.

```javascript filename="Profile.jsx" showLineNumbers {4}
export default function Profile(props) {
    return (
        <div>
            <Card {...props} />
        </div>
    );
}
```

</Steps>

## Sending `JSX` or `Component` as children props

We can wrap another `Component` with a component and send it as `Props`. This is called `children` `Props`. And when receiving it, it must be received with the name `children`.

```javascript filename="Card.jsx" showLineNumbers {3-5}
export default function Profile() {
    return (
        <Card>
            <Profile />
        </Card>
    );
}
```

```javascript filename="Card.jsx" showLineNumbers {1,5}
export default function Card({ children }) {
    // Here the `Profile` component is received as `children`
    return (
        <div className='card'>
            <h1>This is Profile Card</h1>
            {children}
        </div>
    );
}
```

## Props are Immutable: why?

`Props` cannot be changed directly because `props` are `Immutable`. `props` can only be managed through `State` from the `Parent Component`. If a `props` value needs to be changed due to user interaction, React passes new `Props` to the `Child Component`. But it never modifies the previously sent `props`.

After sending new `Props`, the previous `Props` are discarded from JavaScript memory or garbage collected.

Therefore, the value of `Props` can never be changed or overridden within the `Child Component`.
