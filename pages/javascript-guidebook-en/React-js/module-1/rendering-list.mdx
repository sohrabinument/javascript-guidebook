In React, we often need to render lists of data or data from an `Array`. In such cases, we can use `map`, `filter` to display them.

**Example:**

```javascript
const users = ["Mr x", "Mr y", "Mr z"];

export function ListOfUser() {
    const user = users.map((person) => <li>{person}</li>);
    return <ul>{user}</ul>;
}
```

## Usage of `key`:

When rendering a list of items using `map`, each list element must have a `key`.

```javascript
const users = [
    {
        id: 1,
        name: "Mr X",
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        name: "Mr XX",
    },
];

export function ListOfUser() {
    const user = users.map((person) => <li key={person.id}>{person.name}</li>);
    return <ul>{user}</ul>;
}
```

## How to get a `key`?

We can get `keys` in different ways from different data sources, such as:

-   **Data from a database:** The data we get from databases usually comes with an automatic `Id`, which we can use as a `key`.

-   **Local data:** For data that is automatically generated locally, we can use `crypto.randomUUID()` or `uuid` to generate and save an `id/key`.

## Rules of `key`

-   `key` must be unique. The same `key` cannot be used for different elements in the same list.

-   `key` should not be changed or generated during rendering.

-   Never use the index of an `Array` as a `key`.

## Why is `key` needed in React?

React needs `key` to uniquely identify each item in its `DOM TREE`. This way, if an item is deleted from a list or if sorting is needed, React can easily understand which item has changed.
