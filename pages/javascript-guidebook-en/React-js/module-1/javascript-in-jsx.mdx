**In `JSX`, we can write JavaScript and `HTML` markup together. Whenever we need to use a dynamic value in the markup, or perform a logical operation, or even if we need to access the value of a variable or object, we need to write it inside `{ }` double curly braces.**

Example:

```javascript filename="Profile.jsx" showLineNumbers {5-6,8}
export default function Profile(name) {
    let age = 30;
    return (
        <div className='profile-card'>
            <h1>Hello Mr {name}</h1> // name is a dynamic value written using {}
            through JavaScript.
            <p>Your age is {age}</p> // age is a dynamic value from a variable
            written using {}.
            <p>
                You are {age >= 21 ? "Eligable" : "Not Eligable"} for Marraige
                // This line performs a logical operation using JavaScript
            </p>
        </div>
    );
}
```

So with `{ }`, we can write JavaScript expressions inside them.

## Using "double curlies": CSS and other objects in JSX

Example:

```javascript filename="Profile.jsx" showLineNumbers {6,8-11}
export default function Profile(name) {
    let age = 30;
    return (
        <div
            className='profile-card'
            style={{
                // This line contains an object
                backgroundColor: "gray",
                color: "black",
                fontWeight: "bold",
            }}>
            <h1>Hello Mr {name}</h1> // name is a dynamic value written using {}
            through JavaScript.
            <p>Your age is {age}</p> // age is a dynamic value from a variable
            written using {}.
            <p>
                You are {age >= 21 ? "Eligable" : "Not Eligable"} for Marraige
                // This line performs a logical operation using JavaScript
            </p>
        </div>
    );
}
```

When we need to write an object inside `{ }` in `JSX`, we follow the same step. It might seem like we're using `{ }` twice, but that's not the case. The first `{ }` is for creating space for JavaScript, and the second `{ }` is for the object.
