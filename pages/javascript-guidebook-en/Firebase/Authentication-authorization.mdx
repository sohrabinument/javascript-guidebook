### What do Authentication and Authorization mean?
#### What is Authentication?
Authentication means proving that "you are really who you claim to be." In simple terms, when you try to access an account, the system asks you how you can prove your identity. For example, things like passwords, OTPs (like codes received on your mobile), fingerprints - these are used for authentication.

**Example**: When you enter your email and password to log into Facebook, Facebook confirms that you are the owner of this account.

#### What is Authorization?
Authorization is about "which areas you can access, and what you can do." After authentication is complete, the system determines which features or information you have permission to access. Simply put, this is where it's decided what you can and cannot do.

**Example**: After logging into Facebook, you can view your own profile and friends list, but you cannot edit someone else's profile. Authorization determines how much access control you will have.

**Difference between Authentication and Authorization**


Authentication is "who you are?"
