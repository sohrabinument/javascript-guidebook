**Q1: What is Git and why is it used?**  
A: Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your code, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed. It is essential for teamwork and safe code management.

**Q2: How do you initialize a new Git repository?**  
A: Use the following command in your project folder:

```bash
git init
```

**Q3: How do you check the status of your files in Git?**  
A: Use:
```bash
git status
```
This shows which files are staged, unstaged, or untracked.

**Q4: How do you stage and commit changes?**  
A: Stage files with:
```bash
git add <filename>
```
Commit with a message:
```bash
git commit -m "Your message"
```

**Q5: How do you view the commit history?**  
A: Use:
```bash
git log
```
Or for a concise view:
```bash
git log --oneline
```

**Q6: Scenario: You accidentally committed sensitive data. How do you remove it from your history?**  
A: Remove the file and rewrite history:
```bash
git rm --cached <filename>
git commit --amend
# Or use filter-branch or BFG for deep removal
```
<Callout type="warning">Be careful: rewriting history can affect collaborators!</Callout>

**Q7: How do you create and switch to a new branch?**  
A: Create:
```bash
git branch feature-branch
```
Switch:
```bash
git switch feature-branch
```
Or both at once:
```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

**Q8: Scenario: You want to try a risky change without affecting the main branch. What should you do?**  
A: Create a new branch for your experiment:
```bash
git checkout -b experiment
```
Work on the branch, and merge if successful.

**Q9: How do you merge another branch into your current branch?**  
A: Use:
```bash
git merge branch-name
```

**Q10: What is a merge conflict and how do you resolve it?**  
A: A merge conflict happens when changes in two branches overlap. Git marks the conflict in the file. To resolve:
1. Open the file and look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
2. Edit the file to keep the correct changes.
3. Remove the markers.
4. Stage and commit:
```bash
git add <filename>
git commit
```
<Callout type="info">Use a code editor like VS Code for easier conflict resolution.</Callout>

## 1.3 ‚Äì Advanced & Scenario-Based Questions üöÄ

<div style={{ background: 'rgba(20, 120, 220, 0.10)', padding: '15px', borderRadius: '5px', marginBottom: '20px', border: '1px solid rgba(20, 120, 220, 0.15)', color: 'inherit' }}>

**Q11: Scenario: You need to combine several small commits into one before merging. How do you do this?**  
A: Use interactive rebase and squash:
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```
Change "pick" to "squash" for the commits you want to combine, then save and finish the rebase.

**Q12: How do you undo the last commit but keep the changes?**  
A: Use:
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

**Q13: Scenario: You want to temporarily save your work and switch branches. What should you do?**  
A: Use stash:
```bash
git stash
```
Switch branches, then retrieve your work with:
```bash
git stash apply
```

**Q14: How do you delete a branch locally and remotely?**  
A: Locally:
```bash
git branch -d branch-name
```
Remotely:
```bash
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

**Q15: Scenario: You have two GitHub accounts and need to push to different remotes from the same computer. How do you manage this?**  
A: Use separate SSH keys and configure your `~/.ssh/config` file. Example:
```bash
# Personal
Host github-personal
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_personal

# Work
Host github-work
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work
```
Then use the correct remote URL when cloning or pushing.

**Q16: How do you see what changed in a specific commit?**  
A: Use:
```bash
git show <commit-hash>
```
This displays the changes introduced by that commit.

**Q17: Scenario: You want to undo changes in a file and return it to the last committed state. What do you do?**  
A: Use:
```bash
git checkout -- <filename>
```
This will discard local changes in the file.

**Q18: How do you see the difference between your working directory and the last commit?**  
A: Use:
```bash
git diff
```
This shows unstaged changes. To see staged changes, use:
```bash
git diff --cached
```

**Q19: Scenario: You accidentally deleted a file and want to recover it from the last commit. What should you do?**  
A: Use:
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- <filename>
```
This restores the file from the last commit.

**Q20: How do you rename a file in Git and record the change?**  
A: Use:
```bash
git mv oldname.txt newname.txt
git commit -m "Rename file"
```

**Q21: Scenario: You want to see which lines of a file were changed by whom and when. What command do you use?**  
A: Use:
```bash
git blame <filename>
```
This shows line-by-line authorship and commit info.

**Q22: How do you clone a remote repository?**

git clone <repository-url>
```

**Q23: Scenario: You want to remove a file from the repository but keep it locally. What do you do?**

git remote -v
```

**Q25: Scenario: You want to fetch changes from the remote but not merge them automatically. What command do you use?**  
A: Use:
```bash
git fetch
```
This downloads changes but does not merge them.

**Q26: How do you see a graphical representation of your branch history?**  
A: Use:
```bash
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

**Q27: Scenario: You want to revert a commit that has already been pushed to a shared repository. What should you do?**  
A: Use:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```
This creates a new commit that undoes the changes, preserving history.

**Q28: How do you tag a specific commit (for example, for a release)?**  
A: Use:
```bash
git tag v1.0.0 <commit-hash>
