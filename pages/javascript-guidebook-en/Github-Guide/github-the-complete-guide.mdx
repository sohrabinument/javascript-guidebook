## 🤔 What is Git? Why Use Version Control?

Git is a **version control system** - think of it as a time machine for your code! ⏰

### The Problem Git Solves 🧩

Imagine you're writing a story:

📝 **Day 1:** You write Chapter 1  
✏️ **Day 2:** You add Chapter 2 and edit Chapter 1  
😱 **Day 3:** You realize Chapter 1 was better before your edits

**Without Git:** You're stuck! Your original Chapter 1 is gone forever. 💔

**With Git:** You can travel back to any version, see exactly what changed, and even work on multiple story versions simultaneously. ✨

<Callout type="info">
  **Real-world analogy:** Git is like Google Docs' version history, but
  supercharged for developers. It tracks every change, lets multiple people work
  together, and ensures nothing is ever truly lost.
</Callout>

---

## 🏗️ Core Concepts Made Simple

### Repository (Repo) 📁

A **repository** is your project folder with Git superpowers enabled. It's like a regular folder, but Git watches everything inside it and remembers every change you make!

### Commits 📸

A **commit** is a snapshot of your project at a specific moment. Think of it as taking a photo of your work - you can always look back at that exact moment. It's like a save point in a video game!

### Branches 🌳

**Branches** let you work on different features simultaneously. Imagine writing a story where you want to try different endings - each ending is a branch! You can work on parallel versions of your project without breaking your main work.

<Callout type="info">
  **Visualization:** Think of your project as a tree: 🌳 The **trunk** is your
  main branch (usually called `main` or `master`) 🌿 **Branches** are where you
  experiment with new features 🔄 You can always merge branches back into the
  trunk when ready
</Callout>

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### First-Time Setup 🎯

**Configure Your Identity** 👤

Tell Git who you are (this appears in your commits):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

**Set Your Default Editor (Optional)** ✏️

```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"  # VS Code
git config --global core.editor "nano"         # Nano (simple)
```

**Verify Your Setup** ✅

```bash
git config --list
```

💡 **Pro Tip:** Use `git config --global --edit` to open your Git configuration in your default editor for easy editing!

---

## 🚀 Essential Git Commands (Beginner to Advanced)

### Initialize Git 🎬

<Callout type="info">
  **What does this do?** This command tells Git to start watching your folder.
  It's like turning on the "time machine" for your project! ⏰
</Callout>

```bash
git init
```

**What happens:** Git creates a hidden `.git` folder that stores all the version history. Now your folder is a Git repository where you can start tracking changes, saving versions, and collaborating with others.

💡 **Tip:** You can see the hidden `.git` folder with `ls -la` (Linux/Mac) or `dir /a` (Windows). Don't delete it - it contains your entire project history!

---

### Check Git Status 📊

<Callout type="info">
  **Why use this?** This command shows you what files have changed, which are
  staged, and which are not. It's like checking your homework list before
  submitting! Your Git dashboard! 📋
</Callout>

```bash
git status
```

**Example output:**

```
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  new-feature.js
```

💡 **Tip:** Use `git status -s` for a shorter, more compact view of your status!

---

### Stage Files for Git Tracking 📦

<Callout type="info">
  **What does staging mean?** Staging is like putting your homework in your
  backpack before handing it in. Only staged files will be included in your next
  commit! It's like packing items in a box before shipping. 📬
</Callout>

```bash
git add <filename>      # Stage a specific file
git add --all           # Stage all files
git add .               # Stage all files in the current directory
```

**More staging options:**

```bash
git add README.md
git add src/index.js
git add "*.js"          # All JavaScript files
git add src/            # Entire src directory
```

💡 **Pro Tip:** Use `git add -p` to stage parts of files interactively - perfect for when you want to commit only specific changes!

---

### Commit Changes 💾

<Callout type="info">
  **What is a commit?** A commit is like saving a checkpoint in a video game.
  You can always go back to it! It's a snapshot of your project with a
  descriptive message. 🎮
</Callout>

```bash
git commit -m "Your message"
```

Write a message that describes what you changed, like "Add new chapter" or "Fix typo in introduction".

**Writing Good Commit Messages:** ✍️

✅ `Add user login functionality`  
✅ `Fix navbar responsive design`  
✅ `Update API documentation`  
❌ `stuff`  
❌ `fixed it`  
❌ `asdf`

💡 **Pro Tip:** Use `git commit -am "message"` to add and commit tracked files in one command!

---

### Check Git Log 📜

<Callout type="info">
  **Why check the log?** The log shows you all the save points (commits) in your
  project. It's like flipping through your diary to see what you did each day!
  See all your project's snapshots, who made changes, and when. 📖
</Callout>

```bash
git log
# or for a shorter view:
git log --oneline
```

**More log options:**

```bash
git log                           # Detailed log
git log --oneline                # Compact view
git log --graph --oneline --all  # Visual representation of branches
```

💡 **Pro Tip:** Use `git log --author="Your Name"` to see only your commits, or `git log --since="2 weeks ago"` for recent commits!

---

### Go Back from One Commit State to Another ⏪

<Callout type="warning">
  **Be careful!** ⚠️ This can change your project to an earlier state. Make sure
  you really want to go back! Some of these commands can permanently delete
  work.
</Callout>

```bash
git reset --hard <commit id>
```

You can find the commit id from `git log`.

**Other reset options:**

| Scenario                        | Command                         | Effect                             |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Unstage a file                  | `git reset HEAD file.txt`       | Removes from staging area          |
| Undo last commit (keep changes) | `git reset --soft HEAD~1`       | Commit removed, files still staged |
| Undo last commit (lose changes) | `git reset --hard HEAD~1`       | ⚠️ Commit and changes deleted      |
| Restore deleted file            | `git checkout HEAD -- file.txt` | Recovery from last commit          |

💡 **Safety Tip:** Always create a backup branch before using `--hard` reset: `git branch backup-branch`

---

### View Git Log with References for Each Change 🔍

<Callout type="info">
  **What is reflog?** Reflog shows you all the moves you've made in your
  project, even the ones you might have undone! It's your Git safety net. 🥅
</Callout>

```bash
git reflog
```

💡 **Recovery Tip:** If you accidentally reset too far, use `git reflog` to find the commit hash and `git reset --hard <hash>` to get back!

---

### Remove a File from Git Tracking 🗑️

<Callout type="info">
  **Why remove a file?** If you added something by mistake, you can tell Git to
  stop tracking it. Maybe you accidentally added passwords or large files! 🙈
</Callout>

```bash
git rm <filename>
```

💡 **Tip:** Use `git rm --cached <filename>` to remove from Git but keep the file on your computer!

---

## 🌿 Working with Branches

### Why Use Branches? 🤔

Branches let you:

🛡️ Work on features without breaking the main code  
🧪 Experiment safely  
👥 Collaborate without conflicts  
📚 Keep a clean project history

<Callout type="info">
  **Analogy:** Branches are like having multiple drafts of an essay. You can try
  different approaches without losing your original work. 📝
</Callout>

### Create a Branch 🌱

<Callout type="info">
  **What is a branch?** A branch is like a parallel universe for your project.
  You can try new things without changing your main work! 🌌
</Callout>

```bash
git branch <branch name>
```

💡 **Naming Tip:** Use descriptive names like `feature/user-login` or `fix/navbar-bug` to make it clear what the branch is for!

---

### View Branch List 📋

```bash
git branch --list
```

The current branch will have an asterisk (\*) next to it.

💡 **Color Tip:** Use `git branch -a` to see both local and remote branches with nice colors!

---

### Switch from One Branch to Another 🔄

```bash
git switch <branch name>
```

**Or create and switch in one command:**

```bash
git switch -c <branch name>  # Create and switch to new branch
```

💡 **Quick Tip:** Use `git switch -` to quickly switch back to the previous branch!

---

### Merge Code from One Branch to Another 🔗

<Callout type="warning" emoji="💡">
	**Important:** To bring code from another branch into the branch you want, first use `git switch <branchname>` to go to that branch. Then enter the command below.
</Callout>

```bash
git merge <branch name>
```

**Complete merge workflow:**

```bash
git switch main                    # Switch to main branch
git merge feature/user-login      # Merge feature branch
```

💡 **Clean Merge Tip:** Always test your code after merging and consider using `git merge --no-ff` to preserve branch history!

---

### Delete a Branch from Git (All Methods, When & Why) 🗑️

There are several ways to delete a branch, depending on whether it's local (on your computer) or remote (on GitHub).

#### Delete a Local Branch 🏠

```bash
git branch -d branch-name
```

🔹 The `-d` flag means "delete". This will only delete the branch if it has been fully merged (safe delete).

**Force delete (if not merged):**

```bash
git branch -D branch-name
```

🔹 The `-D` flag means "delete anyway". Use this if you are sure you don't need the branch's changes.

**When and Why?** 🤔

✅ Delete a branch after you've merged its changes into your main branch (like `main` or `master`)  
🧹 Clean up old branches to keep your project tidy  
⚠️ Only force delete if you are sure you don't need the work in that branch

#### Delete a Remote Branch (on GitHub) ☁️

```bash
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

🔹 This tells GitHub to remove the branch from the remote repository.

**When and Why?** 🤔

✅ After merging a pull request, delete the remote branch to keep your GitHub repo clean  
🚫 Prevents confusion and accidental work on old branches

💡 **Automation Tip:** Many teams set up GitHub to automatically delete branches after merging pull requests!

---

### Change Branch Name ✏️

<Callout type="warning" emoji="💡">
	**Important:** To change the name of a branch, first use `git switch <branchname>` to go to that branch. Then enter the command below.
</Callout>

```bash
git branch -m <updated branch name>
```

### Branch Naming Conventions 📝

| Type    | Format                | Example                 |
| ------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Feature | `feature/description` | `feature/user-login`    |
| Bug Fix | `fix/description`     | `fix/navbar-responsive` |
| Hotfix  | `hotfix/description`  | `hotfix/security-patch` |
| Release | `release/version`     | `release/v1.2.0`        |

💡 **Team Tip:** Agree on naming conventions with your team before starting the project!

---

## 💾 Git Stashing

### Stash Git Changes (Save Uncommitted Work in Git Draft) 📋

<Callout type="info">
  **What is stashing?** Stashing is like putting your work in a drawer for
  later, so you can work on something else! Temporarily save your work without
  committing. 🗄️
</Callout>

```bash
git stash
```

**Named stash with message:**

```bash
git stash push -m "WIP: user login form"
```

💡 **Organization Tip:** Always use descriptive messages with your stashes - you'll thank yourself later!

---

### Check Stash List 📜

```bash
git stash list
```

💡 **Quick View Tip:** Use `git stash list --oneline` for a cleaner view of your stashes!

---

### See What Was Saved in Git Stash 👀

```bash
git stash show -p
```

**Show specific stash:**

```bash
git stash show stash@{0}  # Show stash contents
```

💡 **Detailed View Tip:** Add `-p` to see the actual changes, not just file names!

---

### Apply Git Stash 🔄

```bash
git stash apply <stash id>
# or to apply and remove from stash:
git stash pop
```

**Apply specific stash:**

```bash
git stash apply stash@{0}  # Apply specific stash
git stash drop stash@{0}   # Delete specific stash
```

💡 **Safety Tip:** Use `apply` instead of `pop` if you want to keep the stash as backup!

---

## 🔧 File Management and .gitignore

### If You Accidentally Add a File to Git 🙈

Sometimes you realize after committing that you want to ignore a file from Git:

**First Step:**  
Create a .gitignore file and add the name of that file to it.

**Second Step:**

```bash
git rm --cached <filename>
```

### .gitignore Examples 📝

## 🌐 Working with GitHub

### What is GitHub? 🐙

GitHub is like Google Drive for code - it stores your Git repositories online and adds collaboration features like:

📋 Issue tracking  
🔄 Pull requests  
👥 Team management  
🚀 Automated deployments

GitHub is like a giant library where you can keep your Git projects online, share them with friends, and work together. It's also a place to show off your work and get help from others!

### Add or Push Files to GitHub or a Remote Repository 📤

**First Step:**

```bash
git remote add <origin name> <github repository link>
```

Example:  
`git remote add origin git@github.com:YourUsername/your-repo.git`

**Second Step:**

```bash
git push -u <origin name> <branch name>
```

Example:  
`git push -u origin main`

💡 **First Push Tip:** The `-u` flag sets up tracking, so next time you can just use `git push`!

### Setting Up SSH (Recommended) 🔐

**Create SSH Key** 🗝️

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
```

Press Enter for default location, set a passphrase (optional).

**Add SSH Key to GitHub** ➕

1. Copy your public key:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
2. Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys
3. Click "New SSH key" and paste your key

**Test Connection** 🧪

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see: "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated..."

💡 **Security Tip:** Always use SSH keys instead of passwords for better security and convenience!

---

### Pull from Remote Repository ⬇️

```bash
git pull
```

💡 **Good Practice Tip:** Always pull before starting new work to get the latest changes!

---

### Fetch from Remote Repository (See Changes Without Merging) 👁️

```bash
git fetch
```

### Understanding Push, Pull, Fetch 🔄

📤 **Push:** Upload your commits to GitHub. Like sending your homework to your teacher.  
📥 **Pull:** Download and merge changes from GitHub. Like getting the latest version of your group project.  
👀 **Fetch:** Download changes without merging. Like checking what your friends did, but not adding it to your work yet.

| Command     | What it does                      |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| `git push`  | Uploads your commits              |
| `git pull`  | Fetches and merges remote changes |
| `git fetch` | Only fetches, does not merge      |

<Callout type="info">
  **Important:** Always pull before you push! This keeps your work up to date
  with your friends. 🤝
</Callout>

---

## 🔄 Pull Requests Workflow

**Create Feature Branch** 🌿

```bash
git switch -c feature/awesome-feature
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add awesome feature"
```

**Push Branch to GitHub** 📤

```bash
git push -u origin feature/awesome-feature
```

**Create Pull Request** 📋

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Compare & pull request"
3. Add description and request reviewers
4. Click "Create pull request"

**Merge and Clean Up** 🧹

After approval:

```bash
git switch main
git pull                                    # Get latest changes
git branch -d feature/awesome-feature       # Delete local branch
git push origin --delete feature/awesome-feature  # Delete remote branch
```

💡 **Review Tip:** Always review your own pull request first before asking others to review it!

## 🚨 Handling Merge Conflicts

### What is a Merge Conflict? 💥

A merge conflict happens when Git can't automatically combine changes from different branches. It's like two people editing the same sentence in a document - Git needs you to decide which version to keep.

When you work with others or even just on different branches, sometimes two people (or two branches) change the same part of a file. When you try to merge those changes, Git doesn't know which version to keep.

### How to Know You Have a Merge Conflict 🚨

⚠️ When you run `git merge branch-name`, Git will stop and show a message like:

> CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in filename.txt

📱 Your terminal will say: "Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result."

📊 If you run `git status`, you'll see files marked as "Unmerged"

### Resolving Conflicts Step by Step 🛠️

**Try to merge** 🔄

```bash
git merge branch-name
```

If there's a conflict, Git will tell you which files are affected.

**Open the conflicted file(s)** 📝

Open the file in your code editor. You'll see special markers like this:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes (from the branch you're on)
=======
Their changes (from the branch you're merging in)
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

🔹 Everything between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` is your version  
🔹 Everything between `=======` and `>>>>>>> branch-name` is the other branch's version

**Decide what to keep** 🤔

Read both versions. Decide if you want to keep your changes, their changes, or a mix of both.
Edit the file so it looks the way you want.
**Remove all the conflict markers** (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).

**Example:**

Before:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Hello, world!
=======
Hello, Git!
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

After (if you want both):

```
Hello, world!
Hello, Git!
```

Or (if you want just one):

```
Hello, world!
```

**Mark the conflict as resolved** ✅

Save the file and tell Git you've fixed the conflict:

```bash
git add filename.txt
```

**Complete the merge** 🏁

If all conflicts are resolved, finish the merge:

```bash
git commit
```

Git may auto-create a commit message for you.

### Tips for Beginners 💡

⏰ **Take your time:** Read both versions carefully. If you're not sure, ask a teammate or check the project's history  
🖥️ **Use your code editor:** Most editors (like VS Code) highlight conflicts and make it easy to choose which changes to keep  
🧪 **Test your code:** After resolving conflicts, run your project to make sure everything works as expected  
😌 **Don't panic!** Merge conflicts are normal and happen to everyone. The more you practice, the easier they get

<Callout type="info">
  **Remember:** Merge conflicts are like two people writing on the same page.
  You just need to decide what the final story should say! 📖
</Callout>

## 🔄 Merge, Rebase & Squash Explained Simply

Understanding these three concepts is crucial for Git mastery. Let's break them down with simple analogies and clear examples.

### What is Merge? 🔗

**Merge** combines two branches together, preserving the history of both branches.

#### The Library Analogy 📚

Imagine you and your friend are both writing chapters for the same book:

- You write Chapter 1 and 2 in your notebook
- Your friend writes Chapter 3 and 4 in their notebook
- **Merging** is like combining both notebooks into one final book, keeping track of who wrote what and when

#### Visual Example:

**Before Merge:**

```
main:     A---B---C
               \
feature:        D---E
```

**After Merge:**

```
main:     A---B---C---F (merge commit)
               \     /
feature:        D---E
```

#### When to Use Merge? 🤔

✅ When you want to preserve the complete history of your feature branch  
✅ When working in a team and you want to see who contributed what  
✅ When you want to be able to easily revert an entire feature

**Command:**

```bash
git switch main
git merge feature/user-login
```

---

### What is Rebase? 🔀

**Rebase** moves your branch to start from the latest point of another branch, replaying your changes as if they happened after the latest changes.

#### The Moving House Analogy 🏠

Imagine you're building a house extension:

- You start building on the current foundation
- While you're building, someone renovates the main house
- **Rebasing** is like moving your extension to attach to the newly renovated house, making it look like you built the extension after the renovation was complete

#### Visual Example:

**Before Rebase:**

```
main:     A---B---C---F
               \
feature:        D---E
```

**After Rebase:**

```
main:     A---B---C---F
                       \
feature:                D'---E'
```

Notice how D and E become D' and E' - they're the same changes but now applied on top of F.

#### When to Use Rebase? 🤔

✅ When you want a clean, linear project history  
✅ Before merging your feature branch to make the history cleaner  
✅ When you want to update your feature branch with the latest main branch changes

**Commands:**

```bash
git switch feature/user-login
git rebase main
```

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** Never rebase branches that others are working on! Only rebase
  your own feature branches. Rebasing rewrites history, which can confuse your
  teammates. ⚠️
</Callout>

---

### What is Squash? 🤏

**Squash** combines multiple commits into a single commit, cleaning up your commit history.

#### The Rough Draft Analogy 📝

Imagine writing an essay:

- Draft 1: "Write introduction"
- Draft 2: "Fix typo in introduction"
- Draft 3: "Add conclusion"
- Draft 4: "Fix typo in conclusion"
- Draft 5: "Final review"

**Squashing** is like combining all these drafts into one final commit: "Write complete essay with introduction and conclusion"

#### Visual Example:

**Before Squash:**

```
feature: A---B---C---D---E
         |   |   |   |   |
         |   |   |   |   └── Fix final typo
         |   |   |   └────── Add error handling
         |   |   └────────── Fix bug in login
         |   └────────────── Add login form
         └────────────────── Start login feature
```

**After Squash:**

```
feature: A'
         |
         └── Add complete user login functionality
```

#### When to Use Squash? 🤔

✅ Before merging a feature branch to clean up "work-in-progress" commits  
✅ When you have many small commits that don't add value to the project history  
✅ When you want to present a clean, professional commit history

#### How to Squash (Step by Step) 👣

**Interactive Rebase Method:**

1. **Decide** how many commits you want to squash (let's say the last 3):

   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~3
   ```

2. **An editor opens** showing your commits:

   ```
   pick a1b2c3d Start login feature
   pick b2c3d4e Add login form
   pick c3d4e5f Fix bug in login
   ```

3. **Change** `pick` to `squash` (or `s`) for commits you want to combine:

   ```
   pick a1b2c3d Start login feature
   squash b2c3d4e Add login form
   squash c3d4e5f Fix bug in login
   ```

4. **Save and close** the editor. Git will ask you to write a new commit message.

5. **Write a clear message** for the combined commit:

   ```
   Add complete user login functionality

   - Create login form with validation
   - Add authentication logic
   - Handle login errors appropriately
   ```

6. **Save and close** again. Your commits are now squashed! 🎉

**What does `HEAD~3` mean?** 🤔

🎯 `HEAD` = the latest commit on your current branch  
🔢 `~3` = go back 3 commits from HEAD  
📋 So `HEAD~3` = show me the last 3 commits for editing

### Choosing Between Merge, Rebase, and Squash 🤔

Here's a simple decision tree:

#### Use **Merge** when:

✅ You want to preserve the complete history of feature development  
✅ Multiple people worked on the feature branch  
✅ You want to easily revert an entire feature later  
✅ You're following a "Git Flow" workflow  
✅ Your team prefers transparency over clean history

**Example scenario:** A major feature like "user authentication" that took weeks and involved multiple developers.

#### Use **Rebase** when:

✅ You want a clean, linear project history  
✅ You're working alone on a feature branch  
✅ You want to update your feature branch with latest main changes  
✅ Your team prefers clean history over detailed tracking  
✅ You're preparing to merge and want to avoid merge commits

**Example scenario:** A small bug fix or feature that you developed solo and want to integrate cleanly.

#### Use **Squash** when:

✅ You have many "work in progress" commits  
✅ Your commit messages are messy or not meaningful  
✅ You want one clean commit per feature  
✅ You're about to create a pull request  
✅ Your commits include things like "fix typo", "oops forgot semicolon"

**Example scenario:** You made 15 commits while developing a login form, including fixes, typos, and experiments.

---

### Workflow Combinations 🔄

**Common Professional Workflow:**

1. **Create feature branch** from main
2. **Work and commit** frequently (messy commits are OK)
3. **Rebase** your branch on latest main to stay updated
4. **Squash** related commits to clean up history
5. **Merge** (or squash merge) into main via pull request

```bash
# Step 1: Create and work on feature
git switch -c feature/user-profile
# ... make commits ...

# Step 2: Update with latest main
git switch main
git pull
git switch feature/user-profile
git rebase main

# Step 3: Squash messy commits
git rebase -i HEAD~5  # Squash last 5 commits

# Step 4: Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/user-profile
```

## 🏢 Team Workflows & Best Practices

### Git Flow vs GitHub Flow 🌊

#### Git Flow (Traditional)

```
main ────────────────────────────────
     \                    /
develop ──────────────────
        \        /
feature/  ──────
```

**When to use:** Large teams, scheduled releases, complex projects

#### GitHub Flow (Modern)

```
main ──────────────────────────────
     \              /
feature ──────────
```

**When to use:** Continuous deployment, smaller teams, web applications

### Team Conventions 📋

#### Commit Message Standards

```
type(scope): description

feat(auth): add OAuth login functionality
fix(navbar): resolve mobile responsive issues
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(css): fix indentation in main.css
refactor(api): simplify user data fetching
test(login): add unit tests for authentication
```

#### Branch Naming Conventions

| Type       | Format                   | Example                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Feature    | `feature/description`    | `feature/user-dashboard` |
| Bug Fix    | `fix/description`        | `fix/login-validation`   |
| Hotfix     | `hotfix/description`     | `hotfix/security-patch`  |
| Release    | `release/version`        | `release/v2.1.0`         |
| Experiment | `experiment/description` | `experiment/new-ui`      |

## 🔧 Advanced Git Techniques

### Cherry Pick (Copy Specific Commits) 🍒

**What it does:** Copy a specific commit from one branch to another.

```bash
# Copy commit abc123 to current branch
git cherry-pick abc123

# Copy multiple commits
git cherry-pick abc123 def456 ghi789

# Copy a range of commits
git cherry-pick abc123..def456
```

**When to use:**
✅ You need a bug fix from another branch  
✅ You want to apply a specific feature without merging everything  
✅ You accidentally committed to the wrong branch

### Interactive Rebase (Advanced History Editing) ✏️

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~5  # Edit last 5 commits
```

**Options in interactive rebase:**

- `pick` - Keep the commit as is
- `reword` - Change the commit message
- `edit` - Stop and modify the commit
- `squash` - Combine with previous commit
- `drop` - Remove the commit entirely

**Example workflow:**

```
pick a1b2c3d Add user registration
reword b2c3d4e Fix typo in email validation
squash c3d4e5f Update email validation tests
drop d4e5f6g Debug logging (remove this)
edit e5f6g7h Add password strength checker
```

### Bisect (Find Bug-Introducing Commit) 🔍

**What it does:** Binary search through commits to find when a bug was introduced.

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad                    # Current commit has the bug
git bisect good v1.0             # This version was working
# Git will check out commits for you to test
git bisect good                  # If current commit works
git bisect bad                   # If current commit has bug
# Repeat until Git finds the problematic commit
git bisect reset                 # Return to original state
```

### Worktrees (Multiple Working Directories) 🌳

**What it does:** Work on multiple branches simultaneously in different folders.

```bash
git worktree add ../feature-branch feature/new-ui
git worktree add ../hotfix-branch hotfix/critical-bug

# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove worktree
git worktree remove ../feature-branch
```

**When to use:**
✅ You need to switch between branches frequently  
✅ You want to run tests on one branch while working on another  
✅ You're comparing implementations across branches

---

## 🐛 Common Mistakes & How to Fix Them

### "I committed to the wrong branch!" 😱

**Solution 1: Move last commit to another branch**

```bash
# Create new branch from current position
git branch feature/correct-branch

# Reset current branch to previous commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Switch to new branch (your commit is safe there)
git switch feature/correct-branch
```

**Solution 2: Cherry-pick to correct branch**

```bash
# Note the commit hash
git log --oneline -1  # abc123 Your commit message

# Switch to correct branch
git switch correct-branch

# Copy the commit
git cherry-pick abc123

# Go back and remove from wrong branch
git switch wrong-branch
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### "I want to undo my last commit but keep the changes" 🔄

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

Your files stay modified, but the commit is undone.

### "I accidentally deleted a file" 📂

**If you haven't committed yet:**

```bash
git checkout HEAD -- filename.txt
```

**If you committed the deletion and want it back:**

```bash
git show HEAD~1:filename.txt > filename.txt
```

### "I made a typo in my last commit message" ✏️

```bash
git commit --amend -m "Correct commit message"
```

### "I want to completely undo the last commit" ⚠️

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

**Warning:** This permanently deletes the commit and all changes!

### "I pushed something I shouldn't have" 🚨

**If no one else has pulled yet:**

```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin branch-name
```

**If others might have pulled:**

```bash
git revert abc123  # Creates a new commit that undoes abc123
git push origin branch-name
```

## 🔐 Git Security & Best Practices

### Protecting Sensitive Information 🛡️

#### Never Commit These:

❌ Passwords, API keys, tokens  
❌ Database credentials  
❌ Private keys (SSH, SSL certificates)  
❌ Personal information  
❌ Large binary files

#### .gitignore for Security

```gitignore
# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.production
.env.staging

# Configuration files with secrets
config/secrets.yml
config/database.yml

# Log files that might contain sensitive data
*.log
logs/

# IDE files that might contain project info
.vscode/settings.json
.idea/
```

#### If You Accidentally Committed Secrets 🚨

**Step 1: Remove from future commits**

```bash
echo "config/secrets.yml" >> .gitignore
git rm --cached config/secrets.yml
git commit -m "Remove secrets file from tracking"
```

**Step 2: Clean history (if needed)**

```bash
# For recent commits
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch config/secrets.yml' \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

**Step 3: Change the compromised secrets immediately**

### Signing Commits 🔏

```bash
# Set up GPG signing
git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID
git config --global commit.gpgsign true

# Sign individual commits
git commit -S -m "Signed commit message"
```

---

## 🚀 Git Performance & Large Projects

### Handling Large Files 📦

#### Git LFS (Large File Storage)

```bash
# Install Git LFS
git lfs install

# Track large files
git lfs track "*.psd"
git lfs track "*.zip"
git lfs track "videos/*.mp4"

# Add .gitattributes to your repo
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Add Git LFS tracking"
```

#### Shallow Clones (Faster Downloads)

```bash
# Clone only recent history
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Clone specific branch only
git clone --single-branch --branch main https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

### Optimizing Git Performance ⚡

```bash
# Clean up unnecessary files
git gc --aggressive --prune=now

# Remove untracked files
git clean -fd

# Compress repository
git repack -Ad

# Check repository size
git count-objects -vH
```

---

## 🎯 Git Hooks & Automation

### Client-Side Hooks 🎣

#### Pre-commit Hook (Run Tests Before Commit)

Create `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Run tests before committing
npm test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Tests failed! Commit cancelled."
  exit 1
fi
```

#### Commit Message Hook (Enforce Standards)

Create `.git/hooks/commit-msg`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Check commit message format
if ! grep -qE "^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore)(\(.+\))?: .{1,50}" "$1"; then
  echo "Invalid commit message format!"
  echo "Use: type(scope): description"
  echo "Example: feat(auth): add login functionality"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Server-Side Hooks 🖧

#### Pre-receive Hook (Reject Direct Pushes to Main)

```bash
#!/bin/sh
while read oldrev newrev refname; do
  if [ "$refname" = "refs/heads/main" ]; then
    echo "Direct pushes to main are not allowed!"
    echo "Please use pull requests."
    exit 1
  fi
done
```

---

## 🔧 Git Configuration & Aliases

### Useful Git Aliases ⚡

```bash
# Add to ~/.gitconfig or run these commands:

# Short status
git config --global alias.s "status --short"

# Pretty log
git config --global alias.lg "log --oneline --decorate --graph --all"

# Quick commit
git config --global alias.c "commit -m"

# Quick add and commit

## Managing Multiple GitHub Accounts on One Computer 🔄

> **Common Scenario:** You have a personal GitHub account and a work GitHub account, and you need to use both on the same computer without conflicts! 💼🏠

---

### 🤔 Why You Need Multiple GitHub Accounts

**Common situations:**

- 👔 **Work account** for company projects
- 🏠 **Personal account** for side projects and open source
- 🎓 **School account** for academic work
- 💼 **Client accounts** for freelance work

**The Problem:** Git can only use one GitHub account at a time by default, leading to:

- Commits showing up under the wrong name
- Permission errors when pushing to repositories
- Confusion about which account you're using

---

### 🛠️ Solution Overview

We'll set up multiple accounts using **SSH keys** (recommended method). Here's what we'll do:

1. 🗝️ Create separate SSH keys for each account
2. ⚙️ Configure SSH to use the right key for each account
3. 📁 Set up different Git configurations for different projects
4. 🚀 Use simple commands to switch between accounts

---

### 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create SSH Keys for Each Account 🔑

**For your personal account:**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-personal-email@gmail.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_personal
```

**For your work account:**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-work-email@company.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work
```

**What's happening:**

- `-t ed25519` - Uses the modern, secure Ed25519 algorithm
- `-C "email"` - Adds a comment to identify the key
- `-f ~/.ssh/filename` - Saves the key with a specific name

**You'll now have these files:**

```
~/.ssh/
├── id_ed25519_personal      (private key)
├── id_ed25519_personal.pub  (public key)
├── id_ed25519_work          (private key)
└── id_ed25519_work.pub      (public key)
```

💡 **Security Tip:** When prompted for a passphrase, use one! It adds an extra layer of security.

---

### Step 2: Add SSH Keys to GitHub Accounts 🔗

**For each account, you need to add the PUBLIC key (.pub file):**

#### Personal Account:

1. Copy your personal public key:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_personal.pub
   ```
2. Go to GitHub.com → Settings → SSH and GPG keys
3. Click "New SSH key"
4. Title: "Personal Computer"
5. Paste the key and save

#### Work Account:

1. Copy your work public key:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work.pub
   ```
2. Go to GitHub.com (switch to work account) → Settings → SSH and GPG keys
3. Click "New SSH key"
4. Title: "Work Computer"
5. Paste the key and save

---

### Step 3: Configure SSH to Use Different Keys 🎛️

Create or edit the SSH config file:

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

Add this configuration:

```
# Personal GitHub account
Host github.com-personal
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_personal
    IdentitiesOnly yes

# Work GitHub account
Host github.com-work
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work
    IdentitiesOnly yes
```

**What this does:**

- Creates aliases (`github.com-personal`, `github.com-work`)
- Maps each alias to use a specific SSH key
- `IdentitiesOnly yes` prevents SSH from trying other keys

💡 **Important:** The `Host` names can be anything you want! You could use `personal-github` or `work-gh` instead.

---

### Step 4: Test Your SSH Connections ✅

**Test personal account:**

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com-personal
```

**Test work account:**

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com-work
```

**Expected responses:**

```
Hi YourPersonalUsername! You've successfully authenticated...
Hi YourWorkUsername! You've successfully authenticated...
```

If you get errors, double-check your SSH key setup and config file.

---

## 🚀 Using Multiple Accounts

### Method 1: Repository-Specific Configuration (Recommended) 📁

**For each repository, set the specific user:**

```bash
# In your personal project folder
git config user.name "Your Personal Name"
git config user.email "personal@gmail.com"

# In your work project folder
git config user.name "Your Work Name"
git config user.email "work@company.com"
```

### Method 2: Directory-Based Configuration (Advanced) 📂

**Set up automatic switching based on folder location:**

Edit your global Git config:

```bash
git config --global --edit
```

Add conditional includes:

```ini
[user]
    name = Your Personal Name
    email = personal@gmail.com

[includeIf "gitdir:~/work/"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-work

[includeIf "gitdir:~/company-projects/"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-work
```

Create `~/.gitconfig-work`:

```ini
[user]
    name = Your Work Name
    email = work@company.com
```

**What this does:**

- Personal config is default
- Work config automatically applies in `~/work/` and `~/company-projects/` folders

---

## 🔄 Cloning and Pushing with Multiple Accounts

### Cloning Repositories 📥

**Personal repository:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com-personal:YourPersonalUsername/repo-name.git
```

**Work repository:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com-work:YourWorkUsername/repo-name.git
```

**Notice the difference:** Instead of `git@github.com`, we use our SSH aliases!

### Adding Remotes to Existing Repositories 🔗

**Change existing repository to use personal account:**

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com-personal:YourPersonalUsername/repo-name.git
```

**Change existing repository to use work account:**

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com-work:YourWorkUsername/repo-name.git
```

### Pushing Changes 📤

After setting up the remotes correctly, pushing works normally:

```bash
git push origin main
```

Git will automatically use the correct SSH key based on the remote URL!

---

## 🎯 Quick Setup Scripts

### Script 1: Account Checker 🔍

Create `check-git-account.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== Current Git Configuration ==="
echo "Name: $(git config user.name)"
echo "Email: $(git config user.email)"
echo "Remote URL: $(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null || echo 'No remote set')"
echo "================================="
```

Usage:

```bash
chmod +x check-git-account.sh
./check-git-account.sh
```

### Script 2: Account Switcher 🔄

Create `switch-git-account.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$1" = "personal" ]; then
    git config user.name "Your Personal Name"
    git config user.email "personal@gmail.com"
    echo "✅ Switched to personal account"
elif [ "$1" = "work" ]; then
    git config user.name "Your Work Name"
    git config user.email "work@company.com"
    echo "✅ Switched to work account"
else
    echo "Usage: ./switch-git-account.sh [personal|work]"
fi
```

Usage:

```bash
chmod +x switch-git-account.sh
./switch-git-account.sh personal
./switch-git-account.sh work
```

---

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Permission denied (publickey)" ❌

**Possible causes:**

- SSH key not added to GitHub account
- Wrong SSH key being used
- SSH agent not running

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Check if SSH agent is running
ssh-add -l

# If not running, start it
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add your keys
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_personal
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work

# Test connections again
ssh -T git@github.com-personal
ssh -T git@github.com-work
```

### Issue 2: Commits Showing Wrong Author 👤

**Problem:** Your commits appear under the wrong GitHub account.

**Solution:** Set the correct user for the repository:

```bash
# Check current config
git config user.name
git config user.email

# Set correct config
git config user.name "Correct Name"
git config user.email "correct@email.com"

# For already committed changes
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Change last 3 commits
# Use 'edit' option and run git commit --amend --author="Name <email>"
```

### Issue 3: SSH Config Not Working 🔧

**Check your SSH config syntax:**

```bash
ssh -F ~/.ssh/config -T git@github.com-personal
```

**Common mistakes:**

- Indentation (use spaces, not tabs)
- Typos in hostnames
- Missing `IdentitiesOnly yes`

### Issue 4: Multiple SSH Keys Conflicting 🔀

**Problem:** SSH tries all keys and gets rate limited.

**Solution:** Use `IdentitiesOnly yes` in SSH config and specify exact keys:

```
Host github.com-personal
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_personal
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
```

---

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Using Different Git Aliases 📝

**Add to your shell profile (.bashrc, .zshrc):**

```bash
# Git aliases for different accounts
alias gp-personal='git config user.name "Personal Name" && git config user.email "personal@gmail.com"'
alias gp-work='git config user.name "Work Name" && git config user.email "work@company.com"'

# Clone aliases
alias clone-personal='git clone git@github.com-personal:'
alias clone-work='git clone git@github.com-work:'
```

**Usage:**

```bash
# Set account for current repo
gp-personal
gp-work

# Clone repositories
clone-personal YourUsername/repo-name
clone-work CompanyUsername/repo-name
```

### Global vs Local Git Configuration 🌐

**Understanding the hierarchy:**

1. **System config** (`/etc/gitconfig`) - affects all users
2. **Global config** (`~/.gitconfig`) - affects all your repos
3. **Local config** (`.git/config`) - affects only current repo

**Best practice for multiple accounts:**

- Set **personal** as global default
- Override with **work** config per repository or directory
