# 🔄 Control Flow and Loops: Sarah's Adventure in Code Land 🗺️

Welcome back! Let's follow Sarah as she learns how to make decisions and repeat actions in JavaScript using control flow and loops. Get ready for a journey full of choices, paths, and fun 🎉

## The Story: Sarah's Day at the Amusement Park 🎡

Sarah is spending a day at her favorite amusement park. She faces choices at every ride, snack stand, and game booth. In JavaScript, **control flow** is how we tell our code which path to take—just like Sarah decides what to do next! 🎟️

## 1. If/Else: Should Sarah Ride the Roller Coaster? 🎢

Sarah wants to ride the roller coaster, but only if she's tall enough!

```js
// Sarah checks if she is tall enough for the roller coaster.
let isTallEnough = true;

if (isTallEnough) {
  console.log("Sarah rides the roller coaster! 🎢");
} else {
  console.log("Sarah chooses a different ride. 🎠");
}
```
*If you run this code, you'll see: Sarah rides the roller coaster! 🎢*

- `if` checks a condition.
- `else` runs if the condition is false.
- You can add `else if` for more choices!

## 2. Switch: Which Snack Will Sarah Choose? 🍿

Sarah is hungry and goes to the snack stand. She can pick popcorn, ice cream, or cotton candy.

```js
// Sarah chooses a snack.
let snack = "popcorn";

switch (snack) {
  case "popcorn":
    console.log("Sarah enjoys some popcorn! 🍿");
    break;
  case "ice cream":
    console.log("Sarah eats ice cream! 🍦");
    break;
  case "cotton candy":
    console.log("Sarah munches cotton candy! 🍭");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Sarah grabs a bottle of water. 💧");
}
```
*If you run this code, you'll see: Sarah enjoys some popcorn! 🍿*

- `switch` checks one value against many cases.
- `break` stops checking after a match.
- `default` runs if no cases match.

## 3. Loops: Playing the Ring Toss Game 🎯

Sarah wants to win 3 prizes at the ring toss booth. She keeps playing until she wins enough!

### For Loop: Sarah Throws Rings 🏅

```js
// Sarah throws 3 rings at the booth.
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  console.log(`Sarah throws ring #${i}! 🎯`);
}
```
*This will print: Sarah throws ring #1! 🎯 ... up to #3.*

- `for` loops repeat a block of code a set number of times.

### While Loop: Waiting in Line ⏳

Sarah waits in line for the Ferris wheel. She waits until it's her turn.

```js
// Sarah waits in line until her turn comes.
let inLine = true;
let turns = 0;

while (inLine && turns < 5) {
  turns++;
  console.log(`Sarah waits... (${turns}) ⏳`);
  if (turns === 3) {
    inLine = false;
    console.log("Sarah's turn for the Ferris wheel! 🎡");
  }
}
```
*This will print Sarah waiting, and at turn 3: Sarah's turn for the Ferris wheel! 🎡*

- `while` loops keep going as long as a condition is true.

### Do-While Loop: Trying the Claw Machine 🕹️

Sarah tries the claw machine at least once, even if she's not sure she'll win.

```js
// Sarah tries the claw machine at least once.
let prizeWon = false;
do {
  console.log("Sarah tries the claw machine! 🕹️");
  // Let's pretend she doesn't win this time.
} while (prizeWon);
```
*This always prints: Sarah tries the claw machine! 🕹️*

- `do-while` always runs the code at least once.

## 4. Break and Continue: Exploring the Park 🗺️

Sarah explores 5 attractions, but skips the haunted house and leaves early if she gets tired.

```js
// Sarah explores attractions, skips haunted house, and leaves early if tired.
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) {
    // At attraction 3, it's the haunted house—Sarah skips it!
    console.log("Sarah skips the haunted house! 👻");
    continue;
  }
  if (i === 5) {
    // At attraction 5, Sarah gets tired and leaves the park.
    console.log("Sarah gets tired and leaves the park! 🏡");
    break;
  }
  // For other attractions, Sarah enjoys them.
  console.log(`Sarah enjoys attraction #${i}! 🎢`);
}
```
*This will print enjoying attractions 1, 2, skipping 3, enjoying 4, then leaving at 5.*

## Sarah's Control Flow Tips 💡

- Use `if/else` for simple choices, `switch` for many options.
- Loops help you repeat actions—don't be afraid to use them!
- `break` and `continue` give you more control over your journey.

## Quiz Time! 🎲

1. What does this print?
   ```js
   let hungry = true;
   if (hungry) {
     console.log("Eat a snack! 🍎");
   } else {
     console.log("Keep playing! 🎠");
   }
   ```
2. How many times does this loop run?
   ```js
   for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
     console.log(i);
   }
   ```
3. What does `break` do in a loop?
4. What's the difference between `while` and `do-while`?
