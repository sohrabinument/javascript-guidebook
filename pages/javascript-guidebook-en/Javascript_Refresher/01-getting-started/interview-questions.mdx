## üìù Module 01: Quick Quiz

### Question 1
**What will this code output?**
```js
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 100);
}
```
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>It will print <b>3</b> three times, because <code>var</code> is function-scoped and the loop completes before the timeouts run.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

---

### Question 2
**Which of the following is NOT a valid way to declare a variable in JavaScript?**

- [ ] `let x = 5;`
- [ ] `const y = 10;`

- [x] `int a = 20;`

<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  <ul>
    <li><code>int a = 20;</code> is not valid in JavaScript. Use <code>let</code>, <code>const</code>, or <code>var</code>.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

  function makeCounter() {
    let count = 0;
    return function() {
      count++;
      return count;
    };
  }
  const counter = makeCounter();
  counter(); // 1
  counter(); // 2
  ```
</details>

### Question 5
**Which statement about <code>const</code> is true?**
- [ ] You can reassign a <code>const</code> variable.
- [x] You can change the properties of a <code>const</code> object.
