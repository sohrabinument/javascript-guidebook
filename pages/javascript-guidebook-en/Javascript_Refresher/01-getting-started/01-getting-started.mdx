## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is the language of the web! It lets you make websites interactive, dynamic, and fun. Whenever you see a button that animates, a form that checks your input, or a game in your browserâ€”JavaScript is behind the scenes.

> **Fun Fact:** JavaScript was created in just 10 days!

## How JavaScript Works in the Browser

- JavaScript runs inside your browser's engine (like V8 in Chrome).
- It can interact with HTML and CSS to make pages dynamic.

## Setting Up Your Playground

You only need two things to start coding:
- A web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge)
- A code editor (like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

**Try it now:**  
Open your browser, press `F12` to open DevTools, and go to the "Console" tab. Type:
```js
console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
```
Hit Enter. You just wrote your first JavaScript code!

## Your First Script

Let's add JavaScript to a web page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First JS Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <script>
      alert("Welcome to JavaScript!");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Open this file in your browser and see what happens!
